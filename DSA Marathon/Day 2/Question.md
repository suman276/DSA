<h2 align="center"> Problem Statement</h1>

Given a sorted and rotated array `A` of `N` distinct elements which is rotated at some point, and given an element `K`. The task is to find the index of the given element `K` in the array `A`.

### Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer `T`, denoting the total number of `test cases`. Then `T` test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. First line of each test case contains an integer `N` denoting the size of the given array. Second line of each test case contains `N space separated integers` denoting the elements of the array `A`. Third line of each test case contains an integer `K` denoting the element to be searched in the array.

### Output:
Corresponding to each test case, output the `index` of the element found in the array.  If element is not present, then output `-1`.

### Constraints :
1. T ≤ 100
2. 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
3. 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^8
4. 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^8

### Example Input:
```
